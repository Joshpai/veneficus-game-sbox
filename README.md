# Veneficus
This project was created for the [s&box Game Jam II](https://sbox.game/c/gamejam2).
The link to play is [here](https://sbox.game/turnbackstudios/veneficus-game).

Given the short time period for development, and the small team of three working
on this, we're quite happy with the final result, especially as this was our
first time working together on a project. It was certainly good fun to create.

That being said, this repository will have some questionable code, as I made
quite a few sacrifices in the name of getting things done quickly, not to
mention having to find some strange workarounds for issues. I do hope this can
be useful to someone though in helping better understand the s&box development
process.
